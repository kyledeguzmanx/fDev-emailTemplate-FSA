# INTRODUCTION
This project is an HTML e-mail template. I recreated an e-mail template sent to me from the Federal Student Aid agency.

## NOTES
G-Mail does not accurately render HTML documents. I had to convert CSS stylings to inline stylings. In the future, I must convert my layout to use a table.
## FEATURES
- Responsive Layout
- Font Sizes are based on rem units. It should be responsive as well
